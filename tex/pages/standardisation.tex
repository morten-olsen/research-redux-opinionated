There is a framework for everything, so why not just find a framework that does it? This is a mantra I have seen many use, and while it has its merits, it also has its limitations. The thing is a framework is not a ready to use component, you just dump into the application and then everything is solved, a framework is, as the name implies, just a frame for you to build upon, something the JavaScript community often tries to replace by trying to create a new framework on top of the other one, which is a bit more opinionated, and when that is not enough another is once again added on top.

This generally means that the applications become extremely opinionated with a lot of peoples opinions.

I would like to propose a step back from this world, into a world where a framework is a framework, and on top of that we will add a layer of our own opinions, to create a set of standards to ensure that our everyday work within our product/platform becomes as fast as possible and with as little as possible to worry about or to break.
